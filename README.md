# Apache OpenWhisk Runtime for Deno

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-deno.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/apache/openwhisk-runtime-deno)

This repository contains sources files needed to build the Deno
runtimes for Apache OpenWhisk. The build system will produce an Docker
image for each runtime version. These images are used in the platform
to execute Deno actions.

Try it out using Docker image:

```sh
wsk action create hello main.ts --docker=openwhisk/action-deno-1.3.0
```

The content of the `main.ts` is shown below.
```ts
export default (args: any) => {
  return {
    message: `Hello, ${args.name || 'World'}!`
  }
}
```

## Development

A Dockerfile for each runtime image is defined in its respective
runtime version directory. Modify this file if you need to add extra
dependencies to a runtime version.

### Build

- Run the `distDocker` command to generate local Docker images for the different runtime versions.

```
./gradlew distDocker
```

### Test

1. Build the local Docker images for the Deno runtime (see the instructions above).

2. Install project dependencies from the top-level Apache OpenWhisk
[project](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk), which ensures correct
versions of dependent libraries are available in the Maven cache.

```
./gradlew install
```

*This command **MUST BE** run from the directory containing the main
 Apache OpenWhisk [repository](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk),
 not this repository's directory.*

3. Run the project tests.

```
./gradlew :tests:test
```
